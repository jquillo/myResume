        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>With a lifelong passion for computer technology, I have accumulated over five years of experience in IT-related roles, leveraging my natural aptitude and a determination to continuously learn more. I credit my interest in technology to my early exposure and my older sibling's influence.

As a Supervisor at Geek Squad, I oversee a team of Agents, troubleshooting clients' issues with a wide range of devices, including Windows OS, Mac OS, iPhones, printers, and tablets. My can-do attitude and problem-solving skills enable me to tackle new challenges head-on, ensuring speedy resolution of even the most complex issues.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in IT at Western Governor's University, with a steadfast commitment to achieving excellence in the field of Computer Science. My goal is to obtain CompTIA A+, CySA+, Security+, and Network+ certifications, recognizing that this endeavor will require dedication and perseverance.

I am confident in my ability to overcome any obstacles that may arise on the path to success and am committed to maximizing my potential through continued education and professional development.</p>
